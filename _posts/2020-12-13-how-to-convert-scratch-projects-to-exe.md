### Overview
In this guide, you will learn how to convert your Scratch Project into a Windows executable with a free program called Scratch2Gamemaker. Not only will you be able to export your Scratch Project as a Windows Executable, but you will also be able to export for macOS, Linux, mobile, and even HTML5!

### Installing The Program
To convert your Scratch project, we must first install a free program named Scratch2Gamemaker. Go to the [Scratch2Gamemaker download page](https://scratchconvert.com/scratch2gamemaker), and click on the install button. Once your download has completed, navigate to your downloads folder and run the installer by double-clicking it. Simply follow along with the installer, and customize it as you'd like. Now that Scratch2Gamemaker is installed, run the program by double-clicking the icon on your desktop. If there is no Scratch2Gamemaker icon on your desktop, hit the Windows key and type "Scratch2Gamemaker" and select the first program in the search results.

### Converting Your Scratch Project
Now it's time to convert your Scratch Project! But to do that, we must first download your project. If you are using the web version of Scratch to create your projects, navigate to your game and click "See inside." Once your are in the editor, click on the "File" button on the top tab, and in the dropdown, select "Save to your computer."

Now, in the Scratch2Gamemaker program, drag and drop your project file (it should end in .sb3) right onto the Scratch2Gamemaker program where it says "Drag and drop your .sb3 file here.." Once you drag-and-drop the project file into the program, click on the "Convert" button. Please note that this will NOT delete your Scratch Project file, but will rather create a new folder in the directory where the Scratch Project file originates. Once the conversion finishes, you can navigate to the newly created directory to see the converted project.

### Installing Gamemaker Studio 2
In order to export your project as a Windows Executable, macOS program, a Linux Executable, or a HTML5 game, we must first install Gamemaker Studio 2. To do this, go to the [Gamemaker Studio 2 download page](https://accounts.yoyogames.com/downloads) in your browser of choice. You may need to log in or create a Yoyo Games account first. On the downloads page, click "Download" under the "Windows IDE" section.

In your downloads folder, run the Gamemaker Studio 2 Installer by double-clicking it, like last time, simply follow along with the installer. Once the installation has finished, navigate to your converted Scratch Project's directory and double-click the .yyz file.

### Exporting your Scratch Project as a Windows Executable
Now that your Scratch Project is converted and Gamemaker Studio 2 is installed, all you have to do now is export your project! You can do that with ease by clicking on the "Build" dropdown, and selecting "Create Executable."

Now have to choose in what format you want you want it to be exported as-- either an installer or a .zip file. With an installer, the user will get an .exe installer file which they will have to go through before they can play your game. With a zip file, the user will not have to go through a setup process, but they will have to extract the zip and run the exe file. For now, let's package it as an installer by clicking "Package as Installer." Select the location you want to compile it to, and click "save." The program is now compiling! Once the compile completes, all you need to do is run the .exe file.

### Conclusion
If you would like to further customize your project, we have an article on just that, as well as the basics of GML (Gamemaker Studio 2's coding language.) Happy coding~
