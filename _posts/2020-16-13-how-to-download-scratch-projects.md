## Overview
Before the days of Scratch 3.0, with the introduction of the "See Inside" option, all users had to download projects to view the code or remix the project, but now, all of that could be done online. But that doesn't make downloading a local Scratch Project uneeded. The main reasons to download a Scratch 3.0 project are:
- To edit the project offline
- To keep a local backup in the case that it is deleted online
- To edit projects with a slow or unreliable internet connection
- To download the project's assets

## How to Save a Local Copy
To download your Scratch Project to your computer, simply go to the project you want to download and click "See Inside." In the project editor, click the "file" button on the top-left of your screen and select "Save to your computer" from the dropdown. The file will then be downloaded and saved in the standard .sb3 file format.

## Extracting the Project's Assets
So now that you've downloaded a local copy of your Scratch Project, how do you extract the project's assets & files? It's actually quite simple to do. First, change your file's extension from .sb3 to .zip. You may get a warning, but just click "yes." Next, all we have to do is extract the .zip, simply do this by right-clicking the zip file and selecting "extract zip." Once the zip extracts, you will see all of your project's assets, including all sounds, sprites, and the core of the project: the ``project.json``.
